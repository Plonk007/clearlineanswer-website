      <h2>About Clear Line Answer</h2>
      <p>
        Clear Line Answer was created to support organizations that cannot afford to miss critical calls —
        whether it is a 5 AM attendance line for a production shift or a family reaching out to a funeral home.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are based in the Waterloo Region and focus on delivering a local, human-first experience with
        professional, consistent call handling and clear reporting.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        With experience in operations, customer service, and multi-shift environments, we have built Clear Line Answer
        to remove the stress of attendance calls and after-hours calls from busy teams so they can focus on running
        their organizations.
